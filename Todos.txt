- Change RideOfferController/ client to use protobuf
- handle return values from askRide/ rideOffer to the REST server and client
- test the system with a single client per city
- Zookeeper:
    - leader election: decide on a single server for city to handle request - mostly done
    - failure detection: handle failures of the leader - mostly done
    - atomic broadcast: keep the leader and followers synced on the state of the system

- test the system with multiple servers per shard
- test failure detection and handling
- optional - run servers with dockers


Small fixes:
- handle no possible rides for ride request
-
